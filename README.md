# webpack-react-example

A simple webpack react example

Using:
 - **babel-core**: To transform ES6 to ES5
 - **babel-loader**: Webpack helper to transform js files
 - **babel-preset-env**: Determines which transformations/plugins to use and polyfills (provide modern functionality on older browsers that do not natively support it) based on the browser matrix you want to support
 - **babel-preset-react**: Babel preset for all react plugins.
